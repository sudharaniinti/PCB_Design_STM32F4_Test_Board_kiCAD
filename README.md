# STM32F4_based_PCB_Design_using_kiCAD
This repository contains all the files related to the design of a PCB using KICAD. The PCB is based on the STM32F4-based microcontroller and incorporates a USB interface and a Buck converter.

This repository includes the following files:

1. **Schematic (PDF File)**: A detailed PDF file that presents the circuit connections and component arrangement in a clear and concise manner.

2. **Schematic (kiCAD File)**: The original KICAD file of the schematic, allowing for easy editing and customization.

3. **Netlist**: The netlist file, an essential component of the design, which provides information about the electrical connections between various components and ensures accurate signal flow within the PCB.

4. **PCB Design**: The PCB layout file displaying the placement of components, routing traces, and layers used.

5. **Bill of Materials(BOM)**: The BOM file (in CSV format) listing all the components used in the design along with their quantities and specifications.

6. **Gerber Files**: These files (in ZIP format) are necessary for PCB fabrication. They include all the data required by the manufacturer to produce the physical PCB, such as copper layers, solder mask, silkscreen, drill holes, and board outline.

7. **Component Placement File**: This file (in CSV format) provides the precise coordinates and orientations for placing components on the PCB. It assists during the assembly process by ensuring accurate component placement.
